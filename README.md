4th exercise

---
Create a simple list of orders and list their total QTY and PRICE. QTY and TOTAL should update automatically.

1. Use states for everything
2. Use Components where possible
3. Use apropriate function calls
4. Practice proper usage of Parent and Child ownership.

take note:
QTY and Price still carry over in item. If I change the qty in item 1 it should reflect in total. Same for the Price

If I press on the item box, I should be able to delete the item and reflect the total and qty respectively
